        <p>
          After crashing the RV in a ditch, the drivers climbs out, dons a shirt
          handing from the side view mirror, and retrieves a video camera and
          gun from the vehicle. Recording a message on the camera, the man
          identifies himself as Walter White and bids a cryptic farewell to his
          wife and son as sirens are heard in the distance. Walt then walks onto
          the road and awaits the apparent approach of police, gun in hand.

        <h2>My Partner Jessy Pinkman</h2>
        <p>
          Jesse Bruce Pinkman was born into an upper-middle-class family in
          Albuquerque, New Mexico. At the time the series starts, he has long
          been estranged from his parents due to his drug abuse and lifestyle as
          a drug dealer. After being forced to leave his parents' residence,
          Jesse moved in with his Aunt Ginny, for whom he cared until her death
          from cancer. Afterward, he was allowed to stay in her home, the
          ownership of which fell to Jesse's parents.

        <h2>Last Time Holding a Gun</h2>
        <p>
          My Heisenberg days may have started out for my family, but i kept
          going for myself. There were a number of times throughout the series I
          could have quit the business and had enough money to be set. But I
          didn’t. With this line, it’s almost as if I completes my journey from
          Mr. Chips to Scarface and then moves back a little bit toward the good
          man that I once was.
